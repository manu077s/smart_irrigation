# SMART PLANT MONITORING SYSTEM

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Smart Plant Monitoring System is an IoT-based project designed to monitor plant conditions in real time.
It helps in maintaining proper soil moisture, temperature, and humidity for healthy plant growth.
The system automates irrigation and allows remote monitoring using cloud platforms.

---

## OBJECTIVES

1. Monitor soil moisture levels automatically
2. Measure temperature and humidity of the environment
3. Automate water supply using a relay and water pump
4. Display real-time data on LCD
5. Enable remote monitoring through cloud services

## HARDWARE COMPONENTS USED

NodeMCU ESP32
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Soil Moisture Sensors
5V Relay Module
16×2 LCD Display
5V DC Water Pump
Zero PCB
Jumper Wires
Battery / Power Supply

---

## SOFTWARE AND PLATFORMS

Arduino IDE
Firebase Realtime Database
Blynk Cloud
Adafruit IO
ThingSpeak

---

## WORKING PRINCIPLE

1. Sensors collect data from soil and environment
2. ESP32 processes sensor data
3. Values are displayed on the LCD screen
4. Data is uploaded to cloud platforms
5. If soil moisture is low, the relay turns ON the water pump
6. Irrigation stops automatically when sufficient moisture is detected
